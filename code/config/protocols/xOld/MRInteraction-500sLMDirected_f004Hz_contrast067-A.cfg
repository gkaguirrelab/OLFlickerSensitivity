% Dimming task
attentionTask:d:[0]:Boolean to decide whether we have a dimming task. Needs to be as long as nTrials. Not used in pupillometry
attentionProbability:d:0.333:Probability that the stimulus will turn off in a segment of length specified in attentionSegment
attentionMarginDuration:d:2:Margin in seconds in which we cannot have have a dimming
attentionSegmentDuration:d:12:Duration of segment of the trial duration in which the dimming occurs
attentionBlankDuration:d:0.25:Duration in seconds of the blank durations
