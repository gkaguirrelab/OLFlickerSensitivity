In this part of the experiment you will see a series of images
on the screen, one after the other, including faces, objects,
scenes, and some scrambled images.
 
-----
Your task is to press a button whenever the same image appears
twice in succession (whenever the same image repeats).
-----
 
Try to lie as still as you can, and do not close your
eyes at any point during the experiment.
 
Press any button when you are ready to start...
