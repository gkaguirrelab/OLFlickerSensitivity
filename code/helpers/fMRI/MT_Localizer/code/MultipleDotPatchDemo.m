function MultipleDotPatchDemo
% MultipleDotPatchDemo - Demo to show how to display 2 dot patches.

% For this demo, we'll use the pixel dimensions of our screen to represent
% our coordinate system.  We query the computer for a description of all
% attached displays.  We're going to use the last attached screen to
% display our stimulus.
displayInfo = mglDescribeDisplays;
screenDimsPx = displayInfo(end).screenSizePixel;

% First we'll create our dot patch objects.  The DotPatch class is used to
% represent a dot patch.  This class is separate from the one that actually
% draws the dots on the screen.  DotPatch merely abstracts the positional
% and movement data and provides some helper functions to update their
% position over time.

% Number of dots in the patch.
numDots = 500;

% The dimensions of our patch.  For our purposes, this will the width and
% height of the patch in screen pixels.
patchDims = [500 500];

% The origin of the dot patch.  The dot patch is centered around this point
% in (x,y) space.  This allows you to translate where the patch is located.
center = [-300 0];
	
% Create the actual patch.
dotPatchLeft = DotPatch(numDots, center, patchDims);

% Now we'll make the other patch.
center = [300 0];
dotPatchRight = DotPatch(numDots, center, patchDims);

% A dot patch should have a direction and velocity specified in order to
% animate the dots over time.  Direction is specifed in degress where 0
% degrees is rightward movement.  Velocity is in arbitrary units per
% second.  We specified our dot patches in pixel dimensions so we can treat
% this value in this demo program as pixels per second.
dotPatchLeft.Velocity = 250;
dotPatchRight.Velocity = 125;
dotPatchLeft.Direction = 0;
dotPatchRight.Direction = 180;

% We should also specifiy the coherence of the dot patch.  Coherence is
% specified as a percentage in the range [0,100].  100 being totally coherent
% and 0 having no coherence.
dotPatchLeft.Coherence = 100;
dotPatchRight.Coherence = 50;

% If you want to define the dot direction and coherence in the same fashion
% as the DotThreshold program, take a look at the ConvertCoherence
% function.

% Next we create the GLWindow object that actually displays the dots.  We
% tell it to use the pixel dimensions of the screen as the size of our
% coordinate system.  Position (0,0) is the center of our display.
win = GLWindow('SceneDimensions', screenDimsPx);
win.open;

% We stick the remaining code in a try/catch statement so that if an error
% occurs the open GLWindow object is automatically closed.
